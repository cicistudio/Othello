# Othello for Trubo C 2.0
This Othello chess was wrote by Turbo C 2.0 in year 2005. This project just for memory in my University. I am afraid you can only play it on the DOSBOX now, however you can try use the WinTC tool to compile the code in WinXP system.  I am very sure you can compile those very old codes successfully. please get help from Compile_Readme.docx in root folder.
